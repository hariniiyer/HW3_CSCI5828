<p><b> 2. Now switch your attention to the broken2 program. The only difference between the two programs are the synchronized keywords on the methods contained in ProductionLine.java. For this question, explain why this approach to fixing the program failed. Why is it that synchronizing these methods is not enough. What interactions between the threads are still occuring that cause the program to not be able to produce the correct output? Again, you may use snippets of code and/or output to illustrate your points. The only requirement for this question is that you focus exclusively on issues related to why this particular approach fails to solve the problem. In other words, your answer to this question should be different than your answer to the question above where you are discussing the program and its concurrency problems in general.</b></p>

<p>In the code implementation given in the folder Broken2, the only change is that, in the productionline file, the methods have been synchronized using the keyword “synchronized”. </p>

<p>By using the keyword synchronized on a method, the thread is able to acquire a lock on the method. This prevents any other thread from accessing the shared resource with which the current thread is dealing with. Hence, no other thread can enter that critical section and make changes to the objects and variables inside.</p>


<p>But synchronize keyword does not solve our problem completely. The methods are now synchronized but the product id’s printed are almost in order albeit not correctly. This is because, the methods in Productionline are accessed by the Producer and Consumer threads through the productionline object-’queue’. This is an object oriented program where threads access data through the objects. Hence, synchronizing the methods does not help here. </p>

<p>As only data is synchronized, threads can still interfere with each other because of the unsynchronized object ‘queue’ that we have.</p>
