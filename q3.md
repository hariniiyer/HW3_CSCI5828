<p><b>3. Now turn your attention to creating an implementation of the program that functions correctly in the fixed directory. In your answer to this question, you should discuss the approach you took to fix the problem and get your version of the program to generate output that is similar to the example_output.txt file that is included with the repo. While your output will not match the example_output.txt file exactly, it should have a simliar structure:</b></p>

<p><b>The beginning of the output will show the producers starting up, followed by the consumers, and then their outputs interleaving.At some point, Producers will finish their work and announce that they are shutting down.Consumers will then start to shut down as well as they encounter the special Products that indicate that production is done. All of the producers will eventually shutdown followed by the last couple of consumers shutting down as well.The last part of the file is then a list of product ids from 0 to 199 inclusive.The monitor may generate output at any time, so it might have a message that appears in the final list of ids. That is fine, if that happens to you. A fixed program will then cleanly shutdown and return to the command line prompt.</b></p>

<p>Firstly, we tried to make the run method synchronized in both the Producer.java and Consumer.java files. But, by doing that the program will take time to complete since each thread will acquire a lock to this run method and none of the other threads will be able to execute this method when one thread is holding it. This will now act as a single threaded program. So, we do not adopt this method.</p>

<p>Secondly, we tried to make all the variables volatile so that the changes made in the variables and objects could be seen by all the threads.</p>

<p>In spite of all these changes made, the product id’s printed were still inconsistent. This was because the object queue of productionline class, which was used to call the synchronized methods in productionline.java file, was not synchronised. As soon as the object of productionline class was made to synchronize in both the producer.java and consumer.java files, the output products were printed as required from 0 to 199 since each thread had a lock on this object when performing its operation. </p>
 
<p>Once we synchronize the object of productionline - ‘queue’ in both the Producer.java and Consumer.java files, the product id’s are printed from 0 to 199 without showing any abnormal behaviour.</p>

<p>The queue - object of productionline has been synchronized in the file Consumer.java using syntax synchronized(queue) as shown in the below
