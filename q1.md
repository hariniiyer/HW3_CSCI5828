<p><b>1. Using the material that we have covered in Lectures 8, 9, and 10, explain why the broken program doesn't work. What concurrency-related problems are occuring in this program? If you see the program end in livelock, then describe what is happening with the threads. Why can't they make progress? If you see the program end in another way, such as getting to the point where it prints out the product ids but doesn't include all of them, explain why you think that happened. Note: If you start to add printlnstatements to the Producers and Consumers, you may actually altar the behavior of the program! If you observe this, then also include a discussion on why that happens as well. In your answer, if you want to include snippets of code and/or output to explain what you are seeing, then do so. Use all of Markdown's capabilities to display what you need to explain the concurrency-related problems that you are observing.</b></p>

<p>The program given is a concurrent program as it involves multiple threads running simultaneously. They may or may not run in parallel.We have an unwanted behaviour from the program because there are multiple threads which try to access the shared data at the same time. Hence, broken program does not work.</p>

<p>The problem surfaces when a shared data is accessed by threads simultaneously. This is also known as the race condition.</p>

<p>There is no concurrent control over the threads. Hence, more than one thread can be at a critical section in the same program. This makes race condition unavoidable.
The threads fail to adhere to the mutual exclusion property. The program can read and write the same data. This can corrupt it. </p>

<p>The concurrency related problem that occur are the Queue being shown as empty repeatedly or the queue overflows with products. This is because of the lack of mutual exclusion among the threads. Even when the linked list of products is empty, the consumer program thread can try to access it. Hence, queue empty is repeatedly printed. Similarly when the list containing products overflows, new products are made but there are no consumers and that is the reason we get a queue full statement output.</p>

<p>In a livelock condition, two threads whose output depend on each other keep responding to each other without interruption. Hence, the program gets locked between them. However, the threads are not blocked. This happens between the producer and the consumer.</p>

<p>As producer and consumer threads are interdependent for values, adding print statements alters the behavior of the program by establishing a control to one thread before another tries to access a shared resource. </p>
